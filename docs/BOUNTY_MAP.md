# ETHDenver 2026 Bounty Targets

## Corrected Bounty Strategy

| Our Previous Doc Says | Actual Bounty | Action |
|---|---|---|
| "Base ($10K) -- deploy + OnchainKit" | "Base Self-Sustaining **Autonomous Agents**" | Reframe: settler bot + risk agent |
| "ADI Paymaster ($3K) -- gasless UX" | "ERC-4337 Paymaster **Devtools**" | **DROP** -- wants devtools, not app |
| "ADI Payments ($3K) -- cosmetics" | "Payments for **Merchants**" | **DROP** -- merchant-focused |
| Missing | Uniswap Foundation ($5K) -- integrate API | **ADD** -- swap-to-USDC onramp |
| Missing | 0g Labs DeFAI ($7K) | **ADD** -- risk advisor fits |

## Bounty Table

| # | Bounty | Prize | Requirements | Our Position | Confidence | Hours | Owner |
|---|--------|-------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Kite AI x402 | $10K | Real x402 payment, agent-consumable API | x402 real verification implemented | HIGH | 4-6h | Agent demo PR |
| 2 | Track: New France | $2K | On-chain prediction + vault | Already qualifies | HIGH | 1h | Narrative |
| 3 | Track: Futurllama | $2K | Novel mechanic + agent quoting | Crash-parlay + /quote API | HIGH | 1h | Narrative |
| 4 | Track: Prosperia | $2K | Non-extractive, no owner sweep, social impact | 90/5/5 fee + rehab spec | MEDIUM | 1h | Narrative |
| 5 | Uniswap API | $5K | Integrate Uniswap Trading API | Not started | MEDIUM | 6-8h | Swap-to-USDC |
| 6 | Base Agents | $10K | Self-sustaining autonomous agents on Base | Settler bot + risk agent | MEDIUM | 6-8h | Agent + deploy |
| 7 | ADI Open Project | $19K | Open-ended DeFi innovation on Base | Strong candidate | LOW | 2h | Narrative |
| 8 | 0g Labs DeFAI | $7K | DeFi AI agent using 0g inference | Risk advisor fits | LOW-MED | 4-8h | Stretch |

**Realistic: $31K** (1-6) | **Stretch: $57K** (add 7-8)

## NOT Targeting

- **Hedera** ($25K) -- requires Daml/HTS, out of scope for Solidity stack
- **Canton** ($15K) -- requires Daml
- **QuickNode** ($2K) -- Monad/Hyperliquid specific
- **ADI Paymaster** ($3K) -- wants devtools, not app integration (misread)
- **ADI Payments** ($3K) -- wants merchant payment infra, not cosmetic purchases (misread)

## Priority Order

1. **Kite AI x402 ($10K)** -- real verification done, ship agent demo + docs
2. **Track prizes ($6K)** -- already qualifying, polish narratives
3. **Uniswap API ($5K)** -- swap-to-USDC onramp, needs API key
4. **Base Agents ($10K)** -- settler bot + risk agent, deploy to Sepolia
5. **ADI Open Project ($19K)** -- high prize but low confidence, needs strong application
6. **0g Labs DeFAI ($7K)** -- stretch goal, wrap risk advisor with 0g inference

## Bounty Deep Dives

### Kite AI x402 ($10K)
**What they want:** Agent-native payment protocol. Endpoints that accept x402 payment headers with real on-chain USDC verification on Base.

**What we have:** `packages/services/src/premium/x402.ts` -- real x402 verification using `@x402/express` `paymentMiddleware` with `ExactEvmScheme`. Production mode verifies USDC payments on Base via facilitator. Dev/test mode falls back to stub. Configurable via env vars (`X402_RECIPIENT_WALLET`, `X402_NETWORK`, `X402_FACILITATOR_URL`, `X402_PRICE`). Two x402-gated endpoints: `/premium/sim` and `/premium/risk-assess`.

**What we need:** Agent demo script showing autonomous market discovery -> x402 payment -> risk assessment -> buy/skip decision loop. Agent docs for submission.

### Base Agents ($10K)
**What they want:** Self-sustaining autonomous agents on Base. Not just "deploy on Base" -- they want agents that can operate autonomously.

**What we have:** ParlayEngine with permissionless `settleTicket()`. x402-gated risk advisor. Deploy script for Anvil.

**What we need:** Settler bot (auto-settles resolved tickets). Risk advisor agent (pays x402, assesses, decides). Deploy to Base Sepolia. Frame as "self-sustaining" -- settler earns from x402 fees.

### Uniswap API ($5K)
**What they want:** Projects integrating the Uniswap Trading API or Universal Router.

**What we have:** USDC-denominated vault and betting system. Users need USDC to participate.

**What we need:** `GET /swap/quote` service endpoint proxying to Uniswap API. `SwapToUSDC.tsx` component on ParlayBuilder and VaultDashboard. Permit2 signing. API key application.

### 0g Labs DeFAI ($7K)
**What they want:** DeFi AI agent using 0g inference infrastructure.

**What we have:** Agent-consumable risk advisor API (Kelly criterion, EV, confidence, warnings). Math library for risk computation.

**What we need:** Wrap risk advisor to use 0g inference endpoint for natural language risk explanation. If 0g SDK is lightweight, this could be a simple adapter.

### ADI Open Project ($19K)
**What they want:** Open-ended DeFi innovation on Base.

**What we have:** Full crash-parlay AMM with non-extractive fee routing, live cashout, unified vault liquidity. Strong narrative.

**What we need:** Polish submission narrative. Emphasize innovation (crash-parlay mechanic + x402 agent-native + rehab mode).
